Under the disguise of "better security" Micro$oft-owned GitHub has [discriminated users of 1FA passwords](https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13/) while having commercial interest in success and wide adoption of [FIDO 1FA specifications](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/download/) and [Windows Hello implementation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-in-windows-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422) which [it promotes as a replacement for passwords](https://github.blog/2023-07-12-introducing-passwordless-authentication-on-github-com/). It will result in dire consequencies and is competely inacceptable, [read why](https://codeberg.org/KOLANICH/Fuck-GuanTEEnomo).

If you don't want to participate in harming yourself, it is recommended to follow the lead and migrate somewhere away of GitHub and Micro$oft. Here is [the list of alternatives and rationales to do it](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/49869). If they delete the discussion, there are certain well-known places where you can get a copy of it. [Read why you should also leave GitHub](https://codeberg.org/KOLANICH/Fuck-GuanTEEnomo).

An extremily simple and restricted tool/lib converting binary data into text that can be processed with unsuperwised character-level natural language processing tools/libs.

## Rationale

NLP tools don't work on raw bytes. At least don't work correctly.

The tools it'd be nice to be able to use with binary data:
* [`sentencepiece`](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)
* [`python-bpe`](https://github.com/soaxelbrooke/python-bpe)
* [ðŸ¤—`tokenizers`](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers)
* [`YouTokenToMe`(`yttm`)](https://github.com/VKCOM/YouTokenToMe)
